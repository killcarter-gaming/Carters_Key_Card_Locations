	These keys are needed to open the Gold Lootchests which spawn within the special medical facilitity locations that i have built for the Chernaurus map.
	within these chests there is a small chance for a Vault location key to spawn or possibly two! with these vault keys you can open the locked doors 
	which allow you to gain access to the Vault locations that i have built for the map! within these locations there is a lot of lootchests that spawn.
	the task is simply, you have limited time to loot the location before the door locks you inside with no way to exit. the keys can only be used from 
	the outside so unless you have a friend to open it from the outside for you then you may be there for some time! 
	i have added zombies to the locations and also created new mapgrouppos.xml files with the locations included for those of you who may have trouble doing so!
	all the data for them can be found within my githud at "https://github.com/killcarter-gaming"
	i hope you all like these builds and have fun with your friends raiding them for loot!!
	Carter.
