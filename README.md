# Carters_Key_Card_Locations
Key Card locations for the Key card mod!

These are files pertaining to the locations of the Key card mods vault door locations within the special vault areas that i built for the Chernaurus map.
the vault doors are set to automatically shut at "area_one = 30 mins, area_two = 20 mins and area_three = 15 mins" players need to loot and leave before getting locked in.!!
also contained is the Lootchest mods .json configuration files which i used to spawn gold bars within as a special reward for those that enter the vault location\s.
the lootchests are set so they do not require a player to have a key to open them.
if you wish you can add a key to the lootchests config file in order to force the players to need a key in order to open a chest!
also i added the raw chest locations for those who all ready use the mod and just want to add the data to their existing config file.
i hope these area's are helpful to some folks and you all have fun raiding them.

many thanks...
Carter.
